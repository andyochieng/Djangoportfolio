**Project Overview**
This project is a personal portfolio website built using Django. It showcases my
professional background, skills, and projects, with an integrated contact form that allows
visitors to send messages. The contact form collects data including the user's name, email, 
phone number, and a message, which is saved to a database. This helps in managing and responding
to inquiries from visitors.
The project uses Bootstrap for responsive design and a modern, clean UI/UX. The contact 
form ensures validation for proper data input, and once a user submits the form, a success 
message is displayed.

**Features**

The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, adjusting to various screen sizes using Bootstrap.
